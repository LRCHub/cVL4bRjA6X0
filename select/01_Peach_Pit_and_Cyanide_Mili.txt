Bitter and almondy (And almondy)
Darling, consume it all
Flavor is love, mine is the most pungent
Juicy and savory (Juicy and savory)
Filtering out the pulp
Pour me a cup, let's make it the end

You peeled off fuzzy skin
Carved out a piece
And fed your flesh to the mouths not mine
The sweetest smell
Still lingers on the unwanted peach pit you left behind

Ta-la-la-lil-la
So I took a bite
Tu-lu-lu-lil-la
Let it chip away and grind down
The future I fantasized
Ta-la-la-lil-la
The flavor's kind of nice
Tu-lu-lu-lil-la
Darling, let the cyanide become our spice

Ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta
Ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta
Ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta

I wonder when I stopped fighting against
This version of you (This version of you)
Who's kind to everyone except for me
If we can't go back to where it all started
I'd rather enjoy my time

Ta-la-la-lil-la
Seeing you by my side
Tu-lu-lu-lil-la
Feeling sorry as I cried
'Cause that's our vibe
Ta-la-la-lil-la
So I took a bite
Tu-lu-lu-lil-la
Let it sting and paralyze
My people-pleasing mind
Ta-la-la-lil-la
I too can define
Tu-lu-lu-lil-la
I too know what love tastes like
Sweet cyanide
