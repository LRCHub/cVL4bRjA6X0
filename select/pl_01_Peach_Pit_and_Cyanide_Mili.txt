Bitter and almondy
Darling, consume it all
Flavour is love
Mine is the most pungent
Juicy and savoury
Filtering out the pulp
Pour me a cup
Let's make it the end
You peeled off
Fuzzy skin
Carved out a piece
And fed your flesh to the mouths not mine
The sweetest smell
Still lingers on the unwanted peach pit you left
behind
Talalalila
So I took a bite
Tulululila
Let it chip away and grind down
The future I fantasized
Talalalila
The flavour’s kind of nice
Tulululila
Darling let the cyanide become our spice
Bitter and almondy
Darling, consume it all
Flavour is love
Mine is the most pungent
Juicy and savoury
Filtering out the pulp
Pour me a cup
Let's make it the end
Tatata…
I wonder when I stopped fighting against
This version of you
Who's kind to everyone except for me
If we can't go back
To where it all started
I'd rather enjoy my time
Talalalila
Seeing you by my side
Tulululila
Feeling sorry as I cried
Cause that's our vibe
Talalalila
So I took a bite
Tulululila
Let it sting and paralyze
My people-pleasing mind
Talalalila
I too can define
Tulululila
I too know what love tastes like
Sweet cyanide
Lyx inniphae hon djullay allen
Hassam in yhan
Kuan toulesi que
Aniya na lianna vehe sessue
Hassam inagha
